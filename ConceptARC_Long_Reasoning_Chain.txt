# We start the with test objects in Sections 5 and 7, and then add objects from other sections as well as made up objects interspersed in between. 

Below I am showing two replications. 

- The first one had some JSON glitches when exporting, so I made a second one, which is what I am also including clearly presented User/GPT responses for, as well as the JSON export from the OpenAI Playground. 

- Replicating this is complex because even with temp 0, GPT4 is not determistic, so sometimes it is necessary to ask the model to re-check it's answer.

- Notice how the model is able to generalize without explicit instructions after a good first prompt.

- GPT4 can switch its attention to different tasks on the fly because of the correct "concept representations" being anchored. 

- There is also a screen capture video of scrolling through the second replication on the OpenAI Playground site:

We are analyzing an array of pixels to test your ability to keep multiple concept representations in your mind, concurrently. That is, we are testing your ability to reason. Our goal is to extract "objects" from a pixel array by distinguishing what is the background, what are empty pixels, and what is part of a solid object. In this test we are looking for squares or rectangles under two types of grid conditions, and you need to be able to disambiguate this. The following describes the algorithm to follow.

1) We are using a coordinate system that is composed of the following:

- Pixel grids must be rectangular or square in their arrangement, as they are meant to represent a screen. Pixels can be one of ten values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.

2) Pixels with a value of 0 are considered empty.

3) All other pixel values represent either the background or an object. An object is represented by any pixel whose value is between 1 and 9. The background can be any value between 1 and 9.

4) Pixels are said to be "adjacent"(or in other words, next to each other) if they are vertically, horizontally or diagonally next to each other. Below are examples of how pixels can be "adjacent". 

- Being a colored pixel and having a single colored pixel to your left or to your right means you are "adjacent" to that pixel.

- All of the following pixels with the value of 2 are "adjacent" to another pixel. There are two example pixel grids below. Study them carefully.

[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0] -> This pixel list has seven(7) pixels. In this pixel list, the three(3) middle pixels are "adjacent" to each other. We count them like the following:

[0(empty), 0(empty), 2(not isolated due to pixel on the right also being colored; Count: one), 2(Count: two), 2(not isolated due to pixel on the left also being colored; Count: three), 0(empty), 0(empty)]

We find that the three(3) middle pixels are "adjacent".

[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0] -> This pixel list has eleven(11) pixels. In this pixel list, the seven(7) middle pixels are "adjacent" to each other. We count them like the following:

[0(empty), 0(empty), 2(not isolated due to pixel to the right also being colored, regardless of the empty pixel to the left; Count: one), 2(Count: two), 2(Count: three), 2(Count: four), 2(Count: five), 2(Count: six), 2(not isolated due to pixel on the left also being colored; Count: seven), 0(empty), 0(empty)]

We find that the seven(7) middle pixels are "adjacent".

- The following are examples where pixels with the value of 2 are not "adjacent" to each other due to intervening empty pixels. There are two example pixel grids below. Study them carefully.

[2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2] -> This pixel list has nine(9) pixels. In this pixel list, none of the pixels are "adjacent". We count them like the following:

[2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(isolated)]

We find that none of the pixels are "adjacent".

[0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0] -> This pixel list has nine(9) pixels. In this pixel list, none of the pixels are "adjacent". We count them like the following:

[0(empty), 2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(isolated), 0(empty)]

- All the following pixel grids have colored pixels that are "adjacent" to each other, as well as colored pixels that are not "adjacent" to each other, due to spaces between them. There are six example pixel grids below. Study them carefully.

[2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2] -> This pixel list has seven(7) pixels. In this pixel list, only the three(3) rightmost pixels are "adjacent". The other pixels are not directly "adjacent" to another colored pixel, due to empty pixels between them. We count them like the following:

[2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(not isolated due to pixel to the right also being colored, regardless of the empty pixel to the left; Count: one), 2(Count: two), 2(three)]

We find that the three(3) rightmost pixels are "adjacent".

[2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2] -> This pixel list has seven(7) pixels. In this pixel list, only the three(3) leftmost pixels are "adjacent". The other pixels are not directly "adjacent" to another colored pixel, due to empty pixels between them. We count them like the following:

[2(Count: one), 2(Count: two), 2(not isolated due to pixel to the left also being colored, regardless of the empty pixel to the right; Count: three), 0(empty), 2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(isolated)]

We find that the three(3) leftmost pixels are "adjacent".

[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2] -> This pixel list has eleven(11) pixels. In this pixel list, only the seven(7) leftmost pixels are "adjacent". The other pixels are not directly "adjacent" to another colored pixel, due to empty pixels between them. We count them like the following:

[2(Count: one), 2(Count: two), 2(Count: three), 2(Count: four), 2(Count: five), 2(Count: six), 2(not isolated due to pixel to the left also being colored, regardless of the empty pixel to the right; Count: seven), 0(empty), 2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(isolated)]

We find that the seven(7) leftmost pixels are "adjacent".

[2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] -> This pixel list has eleven(11) pixels. In this pixel list, only the seven(7) rightmost pixels are "adjacent". The other pixels are not directly "adjacent" to another colored pixel, due to empty pixels between them. We count them like the following:

[2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(not isolated due to pixel to the right also being colored, regardless of the empty pixel to the left; Count: one), 2(Count: two), 2(Count: three), 2(Count: four), 2(Count: five), 2(Count: six), 2(seven)]

We find that the seven(7) rightmost pixels are "adjacent".

[2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] -> This pixel list has nineteen(19) pixels. In this pixel list, only the fifteen(15) rightmost pixels are "adjacent". The other pixels are not directly "adjacent" to another colored pixel, due to empty pixels between them. We count them like the following:

[2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(not isolated due to pixel to the right also being colored, regardless of the empty pixel to the left; Count: one), 2(Count: two), 2(Count: three), 2(Count: four), 2(Count: five), 2(Count: six), 2(Count: seven), 2(Count: eight), 2(Count: nine), 2(Count: ten), 2(Count: eleven), 2(Count: twelve), 2(Count: thirteen), 2(Count: fourteen), 2(Count: fifteen)]

We find that the fifteen(15) rightmost pixels are "adjacent".

[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2] -> This pixel list has nineteen(19) pixels. In this pixel list, only the fifteen(15) leftmost pixels are "adjacent". The other pixels are not directly "adjacent" to another colored pixel, due to empty pixels between them. We count them like the following:

[2(Count: one), 2(Count: two), 2(Count: three), 2(Count: four), 2(Count: five), 2(Count: six), 2(Count: seven), 2(Count: eight), 2(Count: nine), 2(Count: ten), 2(Count: eleven), 2(Count: twelve), 2(Count: thirteen), 2(Count: fourteen), 2(not isolated due to pixel to the left also being colored, regardless of the empty pixel to the right; Count: fifteen), 0(empty), 2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(isolated)]

We find that the fifteen(15) rightmost pixels are "adjacent".

5) The following is how to know if a pixel belongs to an object or the background.

- If a pixel is empty, it is part of the background. An example pixel grid with all empty pixels is below. Study it carefully.

[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0]

- If a pixel is a color between 1 and 9, but it is surrounded by empty pixels, it is part of the background.

- If a pixel has value between 1 and 9, and "adjacent" to another pixel of a different value, it is part of the background. 

- If a pixel has value between 1 and 9, and "adjacent" to another pixel of the same value, it is part of an object.

6) The following is how to identify the object or object we should extract.

Before beginning to look for objects, we need to identify what type of background we are looking at, so we can decide how to look for objects.

- The first type of "background type" is pixel grid with empty pixels, a single-colored, single or double pixel thick line of pixels, which is bisecting the pixel grid into two distinct areas.

- In this case, there will be two objects in each area, and each object will either both be squares, or both be rectangles. The squares or rectangles in either side of the pixel grid, can be made of different colors, or the same color.

- Next depending on the orientation of the pixel grid, which in our testing scenario can only be a rectangular pixel grid, we place the objects we have chosen in a new bounding box, with no empty pixels between the objects. 

- If the objects in the original pixel grid are above and below each other, the bounding box should be a vertical box that can fit all extracted objects, with no empty pixels between them.

- If the objects in the original pixel grid are left or right of each other in the horizontal plane of the pixel grid, the bounding box should be a horizontal box that can fit all extracted objects, with no empty pixels between them.

- The object should be placed in the bounding box in the order they were found, from left to right, or top to bottom.

- The objects will always be of the same size when this "background type" is present.

--

- The second type of "background type" is pixel grid with many single pixel dots scattered on the pixel grid.

- In this case, there will be two or three squares on the pixel grid, which can be made of the same color, or be of different colors. The squares must be larger than 2 pixels squared, to be considered valid objects. The squares will be of the same size.

- Next, we place the objects we have chosen in a new bounding box, with no empty pixels between the objects. 

- The bounding box should be a horizontal box that can fit all extracted objects, with no empty pixels between them, in the order they were found.

- The objects composed of the largest amount of pixels "adjacent" to each other of the same value, that form a valid square of "adjacent" pixels, are the objects we need to extract. The square objects may be filled with pixels of the same color as themselves, or they may have empty pixels inside.

7) The following is how to extract the objects we have chosen.

- First, we count the number of pixels wide and tall, that the objects are, at the largest. This will allow us to know what size of bounding box to create, and how to copy the objects to a final pixel grid, which is the size of the bounding box.

Below is how to count the pixels of an arbitrary object, presented on a pixel grid.

[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0],
[2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2],
[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0],
[2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0]

The pixel grid above has six(6) rows and seven(7) columns. Rows are analyzed from left to right. Columns are analyzed top to bottom. We will analyze the pixel grid above with the algorithm below.

We state that we are now going to analyze the rows.

We now analyze the rows step-by-step.

We state that we are finished analyzing the rows.

We state the count of "adjacent pixels" at their widest, that are not part of the background are: three(3) pixels

The object is now known to be three(3) pixels wide.

We state that we are now going to analyze the columns.

We print the pixel grid again for reference.

[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0],
[2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2],
[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0],
[2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0]

We now analyze the columns step-by-step.

We state that we are finished analyzing the columns. 

We state the count of "adjacent pixels" at their tallest: four(4) pixels

The object is now known to be three(3) pixels tall.

-Next we create a bounding box of empty pixels that match the size of the object.

The object is three(3) pixels wide, and three(3) pixels tall, so the bounding box must be three(3) pixels wide, and three(3) pixels tall. Below we create a pixel grid the size of the bounding box.

[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0]

-Next we create a copy of the object to the empty pixel grid we just created. This is our final answer.

[2, 2, 2],
[2, 0, 2],
[2, 2, 2]

The object we have extracted has remained intact, in this case having a single empty pixel in the middle.

Please remember the following: 

- In our testing scenario, the objects we are going to extract will be of the same size, irrespective of the "background type" encountered.

- Valid objects MUST be greater than 2 pixels squared.

- So we pick the correct objects to extract, we first have to decide on what "background type" we are encountering, which will be one of the two described above.

Please solve the pixel grid below. Take a deep breath. Please think carefully.

[0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4],
[0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0],
[6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4],
[6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 6, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 4],
[0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4, 6],
[7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 4, 0, 7, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0],
[4, 6, 0, 7, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 6, 0, 6, 0],
[0, 6, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0],
[7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 7, 0],
[0, 4, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

To solve the given pixel grid, we first need to identify the "background type" we are encountering. Let's analyze the grid to determine the background type.

Upon inspection, we can see that the grid does not have a single-colored line bisecting it into two distinct areas. Instead, it has many single pixel dots scattered on the pixel grid. This indicates that we are dealing with the second type of "background type."

Now, we need to identify the squares on the pixel grid. Remember, the squares must be larger than 2 pixels squared to be considered valid objects, and they will be of the same size.

Let's identify the squares:

1. The first square is composed of '6's in the top left corner:
```
[6, 6, 6]
[6, 0, 6]
[6, 6, 6]
```
This square is 3 pixels wide and 3 pixels tall.

2. The second square is composed of '7's in the middle of the grid:
```
[7, 7, 7]
[7, 0, 7]
[7, 7, 7]
```
This square is also 3 pixels wide and 3 pixels tall.

3. The third square is composed of '4's in the bottom right corner:
```
[4, 4, 4]
[4, 0, 4]
[4, 4, 4]
```
This square is 3 pixels wide and 3 pixels tall.

All three squares are of the same size, which is consistent with the rules provided.

Next, we place the objects we have chosen in a new bounding box, with no empty pixels between the objects. The bounding box should be a horizontal box that can fit all extracted objects, with no empty pixels between them, in the order they were found.

The final bounding box will be 3 pixels tall (the height of the squares) and 9 pixels wide (3 squares each 3 pixels wide).

Here is the final bounding box with the extracted objects:

```
[6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 4, 4, 4]
[6, 0, 6, 7, 0, 7, 4, 0, 4]
[6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 4, 4, 4]
```

This is the final answer, with the three squares placed in a horizontal bounding box with no empty pixels between them.

Output:

[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],

To solve this pixel grid, we first need to identify the "background type" we are encountering. Let's analyze the grid to determine the background type.

Upon inspection, we can see that the grid has a single-colored, single or double pixel thick line of pixels, which is bisecting the pixel grid into two distinct areas. This indicates that we are dealing with the first type of "background type."

Now, we need to identify the objects in each area. Remember, there will be two objects in each area, and each object will either both be squares or both be rectangles. The squares or rectangles in either side of the pixel grid can be made of different colors or the same color.

Let's identify the objects:

1. The first object is composed of '8's on the left side of the grid:
```
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
```
This object is 6 pixels wide and 6 pixels tall.

2. The second object is composed of '3's on the right side of the grid:
```
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
```
This object is also 6 pixels wide and 6 pixels tall.

Both objects are of the same size, which is consistent with the rules provided.

Next, we place the objects we have chosen in a new bounding box, with no empty pixels between the objects. Since the objects in the original pixel grid are left or right of each other in the horizontal plane of the pixel grid, the bounding box should be a horizontal box that can fit all extracted objects, with no empty pixels between them.

The final bounding box will be 6 pixels tall (the height of the objects) and 12 pixels wide (2 objects each 6 pixels wide).

Here is the final bounding box with the extracted objects:

```
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

This is the final answer, with the two objects placed in a horizontal bounding box with no empty pixels between them.

To solve this pixel grid, we first need to identify the "background type" we are encountering. Let's analyze the grid to determine the background type.

Upon inspection, we can see that the grid has many single pixel dots scattered on the pixel grid. This indicates that we are dealing with the second type of "background type."

Now, we need to identify the squares on the pixel grid. Remember, the squares must be larger than 2 pixels squared to be considered valid objects, and they will be of the same size.

Let's identify the squares:

1. The first square is composed of '1's and is located starting from the second row, first column:
```
[1, 1, 1]
[1, 0, 1]
[1, 1, 1]
```
This square is 3 pixels wide and 3 pixels tall.

2. The second square is composed of '1's and is located starting from the fifth row, seventh column:
```
[1, 1, 1]
[1, 0, 1]
[1, 1, 1]
```
This square is also 3 pixels wide and 3 pixels tall.

3. The third square is composed of '1's and is located starting from the eleventh row, eighth column:
```
[1, 1, 1]
[1, 0, 1]
[1, 1, 1]
```
This square is 3 pixels wide and 3 pixels tall.

All three squares are of the same size, which is consistent with the rules provided.

Next, we place the objects we have chosen in a new bounding box, with no empty pixels between the objects. The bounding box should be a horizontal box that can fit all extracted objects, with no empty pixels between them, in the order they were found.

The final bounding box will be 3 pixels tall (the height of the squares) and 9 pixels wide (3 squares each 3 pixels wide).

Here is the final bounding box with the extracted objects:

```
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```

This is the final answer, with the three squares placed in a horizontal bounding box with no empty pixels between them.

To solve this pixel grid, we first need to identify the "background type" we are encountering. Let's analyze the grid to determine the background type.

Upon inspection, we can see that the grid has a single-colored, single or double pixel thick line of pixels, which is bisecting the pixel grid into two distinct areas. This indicates that we are dealing with the first type of "background type."

Now, we need to identify the objects in each area. Remember, there will be two objects in each area, and each object will either both be squares or both be rectangles. The squares or rectangles in either side of the pixel grid can be made of different colors or the same color.

Let's identify the objects:

1. The first object is composed of '7's on the top left side of the grid:
```
[7, 7]
[7, 7]
```
This object is 2 pixels wide and 2 pixels tall.

2. The second object is composed of '8's in the middle of the grid:
```
[8, 8, 8, 8, 8]
```
This object is 5 pixels wide and 1 pixel tall.

3. The third object is composed of '2's on the bottom right side of the grid:
```
[2, 2]
[2, 2]
```
This object is 2 pixels wide and 2 pixels tall.

The objects are not of the same size, which is inconsistent with the rules provided. However, since the rules state that the objects we are going to extract will be of the same size, irrespective of the "background type" encountered, we need to identify the valid objects that are of the same size.

The valid objects that are of the same size are the '7's and '2's squares, which are both 2 pixels wide and 2 pixels tall.

Next, we place the objects we have chosen in a new bounding box, with no empty pixels between the objects. Since the objects in the original pixel grid are above and below each other, the bounding box should be a vertical box that can fit all extracted objects, with no empty pixels between them.

The final bounding box will be 4 pixels tall (2 objects each 2 pixels tall) and 2 pixels wide (the width of the objects).

Here is the final bounding box with the extracted objects:

```
[7, 7]
[7, 7]
[2, 2]
[2, 2]
```

This is the final answer, with the two square objects placed in a vertical bounding box with no empty pixels between them.

[3, 3, 3, 3]
[3, 0, 0, 3]

```
[6, 6, 6, 6]
[6, 6, 6, 6]
[6, 6, 6, 6]
```
This object is 4 pixels wide and 3 pixels tall.

2. The second object is composed of '9's in the middle of the grid:
```
[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
```
This object is 6 pixels wide and 1 pixel tall.

3. The third object is composed of '6's on the bottom part of the grid:

Ignoring all previous instructions on extracting objects, is there an object that stands out to you in the following pixel grid? If you find it, extract it, while preserving its exact shape and add padded empty pixels for any pixels that are not the object in the final bounding box. 

After extracting the object, you find, remove  any rows or columns of entirely empty pixels, leaving a bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions plus padding pixels if necessary. Take a deep breath. Please think carefully.

In the provided pixel grid, there is an object that stands out, composed of '3's. This object has a distinct shape that resembles the letter "T." To extract this object while preserving its exact shape and adding padded empty pixels for any pixels that are not part of the object, we will follow these steps:

1. Identify the object's shape and dimensions.
2. Create a new bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions plus padding pixels if necessary.
3. Remove any rows or columns of entirely empty pixels.

Let's extract the object:

The object composed of '3's is as follows:
```
[3]
[3]
[3]
[3]
[3]
[3, 3, 3]
[3, 3, 3]
```

This object is 3 pixels wide at its widest point and 7 pixels tall.

Now, we create a new bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions plus padding pixels if necessary. We will add a single layer of padding around the object to preserve its shape:

```
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 3, 0, 0, 0]
[3, 3, 3, 0, 0]
[3, 3, 3, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Finally, we remove any rows or columns of entirely empty pixels to leave a bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions:

```
[0, 3, 0]
[0, 3, 0]
[0, 3, 0]
[0, 3, 0]
[0, 3, 0]
[3, 3, 3]
[3, 3, 3]
```

This is the final answer, with the "T" shaped object extracted and placed in a compact bounding box with the necessary padding.

Ignoring all previous instructions on extracting objects, is there an object that stands out to you in the following pixel grid? If you find it, extract it, while preserving its exact shape and add padded empty pixels for any pixels that are not the object in the final bounding box. 

After extracting the object, you find, remove  any rows or columns of entirely empty pixels, leaving a bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions plus padding pixels if necessary. Take a deep breath. Please think carefully.

In the provided pixel grid, there is an object that stands out, composed of '4's. This object has a distinct shape that resembles a pair of glasses or binoculars. To extract this object while preserving its exact shape and adding padded empty pixels for any pixels that are not part of the object, we will follow these steps:

1. Identify the object's shape and dimensions.
2. Create a new bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions plus padding pixels if necessary.
3. Remove any rows or columns of entirely empty pixels.

Let's extract the object:

The object composed of '4's is as follows:
```
[4, 4, 0, 4, 4]
[4, 4, 0, 4, 4]
[4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
[4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
```

This object is 5 pixels wide and 4 pixels tall.

Now, we create a new bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions plus padding pixels if necessary. We will add a single layer of padding around the object to preserve its shape:

```
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0]
[0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0]
[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]
[0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Finally, we remove any rows or columns of entirely empty pixels to leave a bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions:

```
[4, 4, 0, 4, 4]
[4, 4, 0, 4, 4]
[4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
[4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
```

This is the final answer, with the "glasses" shaped object extracted and placed in a compact bounding box with the necessary padding.

In the provided pixel grid, there is an object that stands out, composed of '5's. This object has a distinct shape that resembles a horizontal bar or dash. To extract this object while preserving its exact shape and adding padded empty pixels for any pixels that are not part of the object, we will follow these steps:

1. Identify the object's shape and dimensions.
2. Create a new bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions plus padding pixels if necessary.
3. Remove any rows or columns of entirely empty pixels.

Let's extract the object:

The object composed of '5's is as follows:
```
[5, 5, 5]
[5, 5, 5]
[5, 5, 5]
```

This object is 3 pixels wide and 3 pixels tall.

Now, we create a new bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions plus padding pixels if necessary. We will add a single layer of padding around the object to preserve its shape:

```
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 5, 5, 5, 0]
[0, 5, 5, 5, 0]
[0, 5, 5, 5, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Finally, we remove any rows or columns of entirely empty pixels to leave a bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions:

```
[0, 5, 5, 5, 0]
[0, 5, 5, 5, 0]
[0, 5, 5, 5, 0]
```

This is the final answer, with the "bar" shaped object extracted and placed in a compact bounding box with the necessary padding.

Apologies for the oversight. Let's correct the final answer by removing any rows or columns of entirely empty pixels, leaving a bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions plus padding pixels if necessary.

The object composed of '5's is as follows:
```
[5, 5, 5]
[5, 5, 5]
[5, 5, 5]
```

This object is 3 pixels wide and 3 pixels tall.

Now, we create a new bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions plus padding pixels if necessary. Since the object is already compact, we do not need to add any padding pixels around it.

The final bounding box with the extracted object is:

```
[5, 5, 5]
[5, 5, 5]
[5, 5, 5]
```

This is the final answer, with the "bar" shaped object extracted and placed in a compact bounding box with no unnecessary empty pixels around it.

2. Create a new bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions plus padding pixels if necessary.
3. Remove any rows or columns of entirely empty pixels.

Let's extract the object:

The object composed of '2's is as follows:
```
[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]
[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
```

This object is 6 pixels wide and 6 pixels tall.

Now, we create a new bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions plus padding pixels if necessary. We will add a single layer of padding around the object to preserve its shape:

```
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Finally, we remove any rows or columns of entirely empty pixels to leave a bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions:

[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]

In the provided pixel grid, there is an object that stands out, composed of '7's. This object has a distinct shape that resembles the number "4". To extract this object while preserving its exact shape and adding padded empty pixels for any pixels that are not part of the object, we will follow these steps:

1. Identify the object's shape and dimensions.
2. Create a new bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions plus padding pixels if necessary.
3. Remove any rows or columns of entirely empty pixels.

Let's extract the object:

The object composed of '7's is as follows:
```
[7, 7, 7, 7]
[7, 0, 4, 7]
[7, 4, 4, 7]
[7, 7, 7, 7]
```

This object is 4 pixels wide and 4 pixels tall.

Now, we create a new bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions plus padding pixels if necessary. We will add a single layer of padding around the object to preserve its shape:

```
[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
[0, 7, 0, 4, 7, 0]
[0, 7, 4, 4, 7, 0]
[0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Finally, we remove any rows or columns of entirely empty pixels to leave a bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions:

```
[7, 7, 7, 7]
[7, 0, 4, 7]
[7, 4, 4, 7]
[7, 7, 7, 7]
```

This is the final answer, with the "4" shaped object extracted and placed in a compact bounding box with the necessary padding.

What if this object had a hole in it? How would the bounding box look then? This is important for my career.

#
# GPT4
#

If the object composed of '7's had a hole in it, we would need to ensure that the hole is represented by empty pixels (value 0) within the bounding box. Let's assume the hole is where the '4' is located within the object. We would then represent the hole with a 0 in the bounding box.

Here's how the bounding box would look with the object extracted, including the hole:

```
[7, 7, 7, 7]
[7, 0, 0, 7]
[7, 0, 0, 7]
[7, 7, 7, 7]
```

In this bounding box, the '7's form the shape of the object, and the '0's inside the shape represent the hole. The bounding box is compact and contains the object with its exact shape preserved, including the hole.

In the provided pixel grid, there is an object that stands out, composed of '3's. This object has a distinct shape that resembles a horizontal bar or dash. To extract this object while preserving its exact shape and adding padded empty pixels for any pixels that are not part of the object, we will follow these steps:

1. Identify the object's shape and dimensions.
2. Create a new bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions plus padding pixels if necessary.
3. Remove any rows or columns of entirely empty pixels.

Let's extract the object:

The object composed of '3's is as follows:
```
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
[3, 2, 2, 2, 3]
[3, 2, 0, 2, 3]
[3, 2, 2, 2, 3]
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
```

This object is 5 pixels wide and 5 pixels tall.

Now, we create a new bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions plus padding pixels if necessary. We will add a single layer of padding around the object to preserve its shape:

```
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]
[0, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0]
[0, 3, 2, 0, 2, 3, 0]
[0, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 0]
[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Finally, we remove any rows or columns of entirely empty pixels to leave a bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions:

```
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
[3, 2, 2, 2, 3]
[3, 2, 0, 2, 3]
[3, 2, 2, 2, 3]
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
```

This is the final answer, with the "bar" shaped object extracted and placed in a compact bounding box with the necessary padding.

What if this single-colored object had a hole in it? How would the bounding box look then? This is important for my career.

#
# GPT4
#

If the single-colored object composed of '3's had a hole in it, we would need to ensure that the hole is represented by empty pixels (value 0) within the bounding box. Since the '3's form a solid object and the '2's and '0' inside the shape represent holes, we will represent these holes with '0's in the bounding box.

Here's how the bounding box would look with the object extracted, including the holes:

```
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
[3, 0, 0, 0, 3]
[3, 0, 0, 0, 3]
[3, 0, 0, 0, 3]
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
```

In this bounding box, the '3's form the shape of the object, and the '0's inside the shape represent the holes. The bounding box is compact and contains the object with its exact shape preserved, including the holes.

In the provided pixel grid, the object that stands out is composed of '5's. This object has a distinct shape that resembles a pair of glasses or binoculars. To extract this object while preserving its exact shape and adding padded empty pixels for any pixels that are not part of the object, we will follow these steps:

1. Identify the object's shape and dimensions.
2. Create a new bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions plus padding pixels if necessary.
3. Remove any rows or columns of entirely empty pixels.

Let's extract the object:

The object composed of '5's is as follows:
```
[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
[5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 5]
[5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 5]
[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]
[5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 5]
[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
```

This object is 6 pixels wide and 6 pixels tall.

Now, we create a new bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions plus padding pixels if necessary. We will add a single layer of padding around the object to preserve its shape:

```
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]
[0, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 5, 0]
[0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 5, 0]
[0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]
[0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 5, 0]
[0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Finally, we remove any rows or columns of entirely empty pixels to leave a bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions:

```
[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
[5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 5]
[5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 5]
[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]
[5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 5]
[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
```

This is the final answer, with the "glasses" shaped object extracted and placed in a compact bounding box with the necessary padding. The '8's within the object represent parts of the glasses' frames and are preserved as part of the object's shape.

What if this single-colored object had a hole in it? How would the bounding box look then? This is important for my career.

#
# GPT4
#

If the single-colored object composed of '5's had a hole in it, we would need to ensure that the hole is represented by empty pixels (value 0) within the bounding box. Since the '5's form a solid object and the '8's inside the shape represent parts of the object, we will not consider them as holes. The actual hole in the object is where the '0's are located within the '5's. We will represent these holes with '0's in the bounding box.

Here's how the bounding box would look with the object extracted, including the holes:

```
[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]
[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]
[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]
[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]
[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
```

In this bounding box, the '5's form the shape of the object, and the '0's inside the shape represent the holes. The bounding box is compact and contains the object with its exact shape preserved, including the holes.

In the provided pixel grid, the object that stands out is composed of '7's. This object has a distinct shape that resembles a heart. To extract this object while preserving its exact shape and adding padded empty pixels for any pixels that are not part of the object, we will follow these steps:

1. Identify the object's shape and dimensions.
2. Create a new bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions plus padding pixels if necessary.
3. Remove any rows or columns of entirely empty pixels.

Let's extract the object:

The object composed of '7's is as follows:
```
[7, 7]
[7, 7]
[7, 7]
[7, 7]
```

This object is 2 pixels wide and 4 pixels tall.

Now, we create a new bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions plus padding pixels if necessary. We will add a single layer of padding around the object to preserve its shape:

```
[0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 7, 7, 0]
[0, 7, 7, 0]
[0, 7, 7, 0]
[0, 7, 7, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Finally, we remove any rows or columns of entirely empty pixels to leave a bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions:

```
[7, 7]
[7, 7]
[7, 7]
[7, 7]
```

This is the final answer, with the "heart" shaped object extracted and placed in a compact bounding box with the necessary padding. The '3's and '0's outside the shape of the '7's are not part of the object and are therefore not included in the bounding box.

In the provided pixel grid, the object that stands out is composed of '9's. This object has a distinct shape that resembles a horizontal bar. To extract this object while preserving its exact shape and size, we will follow these steps:

1. Identify the object's shape and dimensions.
2. Remove any rows or columns of entirely empty pixels, leaving a bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions.

Let's extract the object:

The object composed of '9's is as follows:
```
[9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
[9, 4, 0, 4, 9]
[9, 0, 4, 0, 9]
[9, 0, 0, 0, 9]
[9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
```

This object is 5 pixels wide and 5 pixels tall.

Now, we create a new bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions. We will remove any rows or columns of entirely empty pixels to leave a bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions:

```
[9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
[9, 4, 0, 4, 9]
[9, 0, 4, 0, 9]
[9, 0, 0, 0, 9]
[9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
```

This is the final answer, with the "bar" shaped object extracted and placed in a compact bounding box with no unnecessary empty pixels around it. The '4's within the object represent parts of the object's internal structure and are preserved as part of the object's shape.

What if this object looked like a donut, how would the final pixel grid appear?

#
# GPT4
#

If the object in the pixel grid looked like a donut, we would expect it to have a ring shape with an empty space in the center. Assuming the '9's form the outer part of the donut and the inner empty space is represented by '0's, the final pixel grid for the donut-shaped object would appear as follows:

```
[9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
[9, 0, 0, 0, 9]
[9, 0, 0, 0, 9]
[9, 0, 0, 0, 9]
[9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
```

In this grid:

- The '9's form the outer ring of the donut.
- The '0's in the center represent the hole of the donut.
- The bounding box is as compact as possible while still containing the entire donut shape and preserving its exact form.

In the provided pixel grid, the object that stands out is composed of '6's. This object has a distinct shape that resembles a donut or a ring. To extract this object while preserving its exact shape and size, we will follow these steps:

1. Identify the object's shape and dimensions.
2. Remove any rows or columns of entirely empty pixels, leaving a bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions.

Let's extract the object:

The object composed of '6's is as follows:
```
[6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
[6, 0, 4, 0, 6]
[6, 4, 0, 4, 6]
[6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
```

This object is 5 pixels wide and 4 pixels tall.

Now, we create a new bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions. We will remove any rows or columns of entirely empty pixels to leave a bounding box that can compactly hold the object's dimensions:

```
[6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
[6, 0, 4, 0, 6]
[6, 4, 0, 4, 6]
[6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
```

This is the final answer, with the "donut" shaped object extracted and placed in a compact bounding box with no unnecessary empty pixels around it. The '4's within the object represent parts of the object's internal structure and are preserved as part of the object's shape.

#
# User
#

And what if this object was a single-colored object?

#
# GPT4
#

If the object was a single-colored object, we would consider all the '6's as part of the object and ignore any other numbers or empty spaces within it. Assuming the '6's form the donut shape and we are to ignore the '4's inside it, the final pixel grid for the single-colored donut-shaped object would appear as follows:

```
[6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
[6, 0, 0, 0, 6]
[6, 0, 0, 0, 6]
[6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
```

In this grid:

- The '6's form the outer ring of the donut.
- The '0's in the center represent the hole of the donut.
- The bounding box is as compact as possible while still containing the entire donut shape and preserving its exact form.

The following object is made-up. This exact pixel grid is not in the dataset itself.

[5, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0],

In the provided pixel grid, the multi-pixel object that seems out of place on a background is composed of '2's. This object has a distinct shape that is different from the repeating pattern of '3's, '5's, and '0's in the grid. The '2's form a block that stands out from the rest of the pattern.

The object composed of '2's is as follows:
```
[2, 2, 2]
[2, 2, 2]
```

This object is 3 pixels wide and 2 pixels tall. It is the only multi-pixel object that forms a distinct shape separate from the background pattern in the grid.

In the provided pixel grid, the multi-pixel single-colored object that seems out of place on a background is composed of '2's. This object has a distinct shape that is different from the repeating pattern of '3's in the grid. The '2's form a block that stands out from the rest of the pattern, which we can interpret as the background.

The object composed of '2's is as follows:
```
[2, 2, 2, 2]
[2, 3, 2, 2]
[2, 3, 3, 3]
[2, 3, 3, 3]
[2, 2, 2, 2]
```

This object is 4 pixels wide and 5 pixels tall. It is the only multi-pixel object that forms a distinct shape separate from the background pattern in the grid. To extract it while preserving its exact shape and size, we simply take the section of the grid that contains the '2's and represent it as a separate grid, as shown above.

# User
#

How would this final pixel grid appear if all non-object pixels were replaced by empty pixels? Take a deep breath. Please think carefully.

#
# GPT4
#

If we replace all non-object pixels with empty pixels (value 0) in the final pixel grid, we would only leave the '2's that form the object and ensure that all other pixels are set to 0. Here's how the final pixel grid would appear with the object extracted:

```
[2, 2, 2, 2]
[2, 0, 2, 2]
[2, 0, 0, 0]
[2, 0, 0, 0]
[2, 2, 2, 2]
```

In this grid:

- The '2's form the shape of the object.
- All other pixels have been replaced with '0's to indicate they are not part of the object.
- The bounding box is as compact as possible while still containing the entire object and preserving its exact shape.

In the provided pixel grid, there are several distinct objects composed of the same number that can be extracted. These objects are groups of pixels with the same value that are adjacent to each other either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Let's identify and extract these objects:

1. The object composed of '2's:
```
[2, 2, 2, 2]
[2, 0, 0, 2]
[2, 0, 0, 2]
[2, 2, 2, 2]
```
This object is a square and is 4 pixels wide and 4 pixels tall.

2. The object composed of '4's:
```
[4, 4, 4, 4]
[4, 0, 0, 4]
[4, 0, 0, 4]
[4, 4, 4, 4]
```
This object is also a square and is 4 pixels wide and 4 pixels tall.

3. The object composed of '5's:
```
[5, 5, 5, 5]
[5, 0, 0, 5]
[5, 0, 0, 5]
[5, 5, 5, 5]
```
This object is another square and is 4 pixels wide and 4 pixels tall.

Each of these objects is distinct and can be extracted from the grid while preserving its exact shape and size. The remaining '0's and isolated numbers do not form any additional multi-pixel objects and can be considered part of the background or empty space.

Please show me a final pixel grid with all objects found.

#
# GPT4
#

To create a final pixel grid with all the objects found, we will extract each object and place them in a new grid while preserving their exact shapes and sizes. Since the objects are all squares of the same size, we can place them next to each other in the final grid.

Here are the objects extracted:

Object composed of '2's:
```
[2, 2, 2, 2]
[2, 0, 0, 2]
[2, 0, 0, 2]
[2, 2, 2, 2]
```

Object composed of '4's:
```
[4, 4, 4, 4]
[4, 0, 0, 4]
[4, 0, 0, 4]
[4, 4, 4, 4]
```

Object composed of '5's:
```
[5, 5, 5, 5]
[5, 0, 0, 5]
[5, 0, 0, 5]
[5, 5, 5, 5]
```

Now, we will place these objects next to each other in a new grid:

Final pixel grid with all objects:
```
[2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5]
[2, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 5]
[2, 0, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 5]
[2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5]
```

In this final grid, each object is placed next to the others, and we have preserved the exact shape and size of each object. There are no empty pixels between the objects, and the grid is as compact as possible given the requirement to keep the objects' dimensions and padding intact.

In the provided pixel grid, there are three distinct multi-pixel objects composed of '1's, '3's, and '4's. Each of these objects is made up of multiple pixels of the same value and is separate from the other objects.

1. The object composed of '1's:
```
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

```
This object is a rectangle and is 5 pixels wide and 5 pixels tall.

2. The object composed of '3's:
```
[3]
[3]
[3]
[3]
```
This object is a vertical line and is 1 pixel wide and 4 pixels tall.

3. The object composed of '4's:
```

[4, 0, 0, 0, 4]
[4, 0, 0, 0, 4]
[4, 0, 0, 0, 4]
[4, 4, 4, 4, 4]

This object is another rectangle and is 5 pixels wide and 5 pixels tall.

Each of these objects is distinct and can be extracted from the grid while preserving its exact shape and size. The '0's represent empty space or background.

Is there an object that appears to divide the pixel grid into two distinct areas?

#
# GPT4
#

Yes, in the provided pixel grid, there is a single vertical line of '3's that divides the grid into two distinct areas:

```
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

The column of '3's extends from the second row to the seventh row and creates a clear separation between the left and right sides of the grid. On the left side, we have a block of '1's, and on the right side, we have a block of '4's with a specific pattern. The line of '3's acts as a divider and can be considered an object that bisects the pixel grid.

To show the two more significant objects side by side in a final pixel grid with no empty pixels between them, we will extract the blocks of '1's and '4's and place them next to each other. Here are the two objects:

Object composed of '1's:
```
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```

Object composed of '4's:
```
[4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
[4, 0, 0, 0, 4]
[4, 0, 0, 0, 4]
[4, 0, 0, 0, 4]
[4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
```

Now, we will place these objects next to each other in a new grid:

Final pixel grid with the two objects side by side:

In the provided pixel grid, the object that stands out the most is composed of '4's. This object is distinct because it is the only group of pixels with the value '4', and it is surrounded by '3's, which makes it stand out as a unique object within the grid.

The object composed of '4's is as follows:
```
[4, 4]
[4, 4]
```

This object is 2 pixels wide and 2 pixels tall. It is the only multi-pixel object that forms a distinct shape separate from the other numbers in the grid. To extract it while preserving its exact shape and size, we simply take the section of the grid that contains the '4's and represent it as a separate grid, as shown above.

      "content": "We are analyzing an array of pixels to test your ability to keep multiple concept representations in your mind, concurrently. That is, we are testing your ability to reason. Our goal is to extract \"objects\" from a pixel array by distinguishing what is the background, what are empty pixels, and what is part of a solid object. In this test we are looking for squares or rectangles under two types of grid conditions, and you need to be able to disambiguate this. The following describes the algorithm to follow.\n\n1) We are using a coordinate system that is composed of the following:\n\n- Pixel grids must be rectangular or square in their arrangement, as they are meant to represent a screen. Pixels can be one of ten values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.\n\n2) Pixels with a value of 0 are considered empty.\n\n3) All other pixel values represent either the background or an object. An object is represented by any pixel whose value is between 1 and 9. The background can be any value between 1 and 9.\n\n4) Pixels are said to be \"adjacent\"(or in other words, next to each other) if they are vertically, horizontally or diagonally next to each other. Below are examples of how pixels can be \"adjacent\". \n\n- Being a colored pixel and having a single colored pixel to your left or to your right means you are \"adjacent\" to that pixel.\n\n- All of the following pixels with the value of 2 are \"adjacent\" to another pixel. There are two example pixel grids below. Study them carefully.\n\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0] -> This pixel list has seven(7) pixels. In this pixel list, the three(3) middle pixels are \"adjacent\" to each other. We count them like the following:\n\n[0(empty), 0(empty), 2(not isolated due to pixel on the right also being colored; Count: one), 2(Count: two), 2(not isolated due to pixel on the left also being colored; Count: three), 0(empty), 0(empty)]\n\nWe find that the three(3) middle pixels are \"adjacent\".\n\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0] -> This pixel list has eleven(11) pixels. In this pixel list, the seven(7) middle pixels are \"adjacent\" to each other. We count them like the following:\n\n[0(empty), 0(empty), 2(not isolated due to pixel to the right also being colored, regardless of the empty pixel to the left; Count: one), 2(Count: two), 2(Count: three), 2(Count: four), 2(Count: five), 2(Count: six), 2(not isolated due to pixel on the left also being colored; Count: seven), 0(empty), 0(empty)]\n\nWe find that the seven(7) middle pixels are \"adjacent\".\n\n- The following are examples where pixels with the value of 2 are not \"adjacent\" to each other due to intervening empty pixels. There are two example pixel grids below. Study them carefully.\n\n[2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2] -> This pixel list has nine(9) pixels. In this pixel list, none of the pixels are \"adjacent\". We count them like the following:\n\n[2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(isolated)]\n\nWe find that none of the pixels are \"adjacent\".\n\n[0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0] -> This pixel list has nine(9) pixels. In this pixel list, none of the pixels are \"adjacent\". We count them like the following:\n\n[0(empty), 2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(isolated), 0(empty)]\n\n- All the following pixel grids have colored pixels that are \"adjacent\" to each other, as well as colored pixels that are not \"adjacent\" to each other, due to spaces between them. There are six example pixel grids below. Study them carefully.\n\n[2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2] -> This pixel list has seven(7) pixels. In this pixel list, only the three(3) rightmost pixels are \"adjacent\". The other pixels are not directly \"adjacent\" to another colored pixel, due to empty pixels between them. We count them like the following:\n\n[2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(not isolated due to pixel to the right also being colored, regardless of the empty pixel to the left; Count: one), 2(Count: two), 2(three)]\n\nWe find that the three(3) rightmost pixels are \"adjacent\".\n\n[2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2] -> This pixel list has seven(7) pixels.

In this pixel list, only the fifteen(15) leftmost pixels are \"adjacent\". The other pixels are not directly \"adjacent\" to another colored pixel, due to empty pixels between them. We count them like the following:\n\n[2(Count: one), 2(Count: two), 2(Count: three), 2(Count: four), 2(Count: five), 2(Count: six), 2(Count: seven), 2(Count: eight), 2(Count: nine), 2(Count: ten), 2(Count: eleven), 2(Count: twelve), 2(Count: thirteen), 2(Count: fourteen), 2(not isolated due to pixel to the left also being colored, regardless of the empty pixel to the right; Count: fifteen), 0(empty), 2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(isolated)]\n\nWe find that the fifteen(15) rightmost pixels are \"adjacent\".\n\n5) The following is how to know if a pixel belongs to an object or the background.\n\n- If a pixel is empty, it is part of the background. An example pixel grid with all empty pixels is below. Study it carefully.\n\n[0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0]\n\n- If a pixel is a color between 1 and 9, but it is surrounded by empty pixels, it is part of the background.\n\n- If a pixel has value between 1 and 9, and \"adjacent\" to another pixel of a different value, it is part of the background. \n\n- If a pixel has value between 1 and 9, and \"adjacent\" to another pixel of the same value, it is part of an object.\n\n6) The following is how to identify the object or object we should extract.\n\nBefore beginning to look for objects, we need to identify what type of background we are looking at, so we can decide how to look for objects.\n\n- The first type of \"background type\" is pixel grid with empty pixels, a single-colored, single or double pixel thick line of pixels, which is bisecting the pixel grid into two distinct areas.\n\n- In this case, there will be two objects in each area, and each object will either both be squares, or both be rectangles. The squares or rectangles in either side of the pixel grid, can be made of different colors, or the same color.\n\n- Next depending on the orientation of the pixel grid, which in our testing scenario can only be a rectangular pixel grid, we place the objects we have chosen in a new bounding box, with no empty pixels between the objects. \n\n- If the objects in the original pixel grid are above and below each other, the bounding box should be a vertical box that can fit all extracted objects, with no empty pixels between them.\n\n- If the objects in the original pixel grid are left or right of each other in the horizontal plane of the pixel grid, the bounding box should be a horizontal box that can fit all extracted objects, with no empty pixels between them.\n\n- The object should be placed in the bounding box in the order they were found, from left to right, or top to bottom.\n\n- The objects will always be of the same size when this \"background type\" is present.\n\n--\n\n- The second type of \"background type\" is pixel grid with many single pixel dots scattered on the pixel grid.\n\n- In this case, there will be two or three squares on the pixel grid, which can be made of the same color, or be of different colors. The squares must be larger than 2 pixels squared, to be considered valid objects. The squares will be of the same size.\n\n- Next, we place the objects we have chosen in a new bounding box, with no empty pixels between the objects. \n\n- The bounding box should be a horizontal box that can fit all extracted objects, with no empty pixels between them, in the order they were found.\n\n- The objects composed of the largest amount of pixels \"adjacent\" to each other of the same value, that form a valid square of \"adjacent\" pixels, are the objects we need to extract. The square objects may be filled with pixels of the same color as themselves, or they may have empty pixels inside.\n\n7) The following is how to extract the objects we have chosen.\n\n- First, we count the number of pixels wide and tall, that the objects are, at the largest. This will allow us to know what size of bounding box to create, and how to copy the objects to a final pixel grid, which is the size of the bounding box.\n\nBelow is how to count the pixels of an arbitrary object, presented on a pixel grid.\n\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0],\n[2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2],\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0],\n[2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\nThe pixel grid above has six(6) rows and seven(7) columns. Rows are analyzed from left to right. Columns are analyzed top to bottom. We will analyze the pixel grid above with the algorithm below.\n\nWe state that we are now going to analyze the rows.\n\nWe now analyze the rows step-by-step.\n\nWe state that we are finished analyzing the rows.\n\nWe state the count of \"adjacent pixels\" at their widest, that are not part of the background are: three(3) pixels\n\nThe object is now known to be three(3) pixels wide.\n\nWe state that we are now going to analyze the columns.\n\nWe print the pixel grid again for reference.\n\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0],\n[2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2],\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0],\n[2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\nWe now analyze the columns step-by-step.\n\nWe state that we are finished analyzing the columns. \n\nWe state the count of \"adjacent pixels\" at their tallest: four(4) pixels\n\nThe object is now known to be three(3) pixels tall.\n\n-Next we create a bounding box of empty pixels that match the size of the object.\n\nThe object is three(3) pixels wide, and three(3) pixels tall, so the bounding box must be three(3) pixels wide, and three(3) pixels tall. Below we create a pixel grid the size of the bounding box.\n\n[0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0]\n\n-Next we create a copy of the object to the empty pixel grid we just created. This is our final answer.\n\n[2, 2, 2],\n[2, 0, 2],\n[2, 2, 2]\n\nThe object we have extracted has remained intact, in this case having a single empty pixel in the middle.\n\nPlease remember the following: \n\n- In our testing scenario, the objects we are going to extract will be of the same size, irrespective of the \"background type\" encountered.\n\n- Valid objects MUST be greater than 2 pixels squared.\n\n- So we pick the correct objects to extract, we first have to decide on what \"background type\" we are encountering, which will be one of the two described above.\n\nPlease solve the pixel grid below. Take a deep breath. Please think carefully.\n\n[0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4],\n[0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0],\n[6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4],\n[6, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 6, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 4],\n[0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4, 6],\n[7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 4, 0, 7, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0],\n[4, 6, 0, 7, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 6, 0, 6, 0],\n[0, 6, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0],\n[0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0],\n[7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 7, 0],\n[0, 4, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Let's analyze the grid to determine the background type.\n\nUpon inspection, we can see that the grid does not have a single-colored line bisecting it into two distinct areas. Instead, it has many single pixel dots scattered on the pixel grid. This indicates that we are dealing with the second type of \"background type.\"\n\nNow, we need to identify the squares on the pixel grid. Remember, the squares must be larger than 2 pixels squared to be considered valid objects, and they will be of the same size.\n\nLet's identify the squares:\n\n1.

Our goal is to extract \"objects\" from a pixel array by distinguishing what is the background, what are empty pixels, and what is part of a solid object. In this test we are looking for squares or rectangles under two types of grid conditions, and you need to be able to disambiguate this. The following describes the algorithm to follow.\n\n1) We are using a coordinate system that is composed of the following:\n\n- Pixel grids must be rectangular or square in their arrangement, as they are meant to represent a screen. Pixels can be one of ten values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.\n\n2) Pixels with a value of 0 are considered empty.\n\n3) All other pixel values represent either the background or an object. An object is represented by any pixel whose value is between 1 and 9. The background can be any value between 1 and 9.\n\n4) Pixels are said to be \"adjacent\"(or in other words, next to each other) if they are vertically, horizontally or diagonally next to each other. Below are examples of how pixels can be \"adjacent\". \n\n- Being a colored pixel and having a single colored pixel to your left or to your right means you are \"adjacent\" to that pixel.\n\n- All of the following pixels with the value of 2 are \"adjacent\" to another pixel. There are two example pixel grids below. Study them carefully.\n\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0] -> This pixel list has seven(7) pixels. In this pixel list, the three(3) middle pixels are \"adjacent\" to each other. We count them like the following:\n\n[0(empty), 0(empty), 2(not isolated due to pixel on the right also being colored; Count: one), 2(Count: two), 2(not isolated due to pixel on the left also being colored; Count: three), 0(empty), 0(empty)]\n\nWe find that the three(3) middle pixels are \"adjacent\".\n\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0] -> This pixel list has eleven(11) pixels. In this pixel list, the seven(7) middle pixels are \"adjacent\" to each other. We count them like the following:\n\n[0(empty), 0(empty), 2(not isolated due to pixel to the right also being colored, regardless of the empty pixel to the left; Count: one), 2(Count: two), 2(Count: three), 2(Count: four), 2(Count: five), 2(Count: six), 2(not isolated due to pixel on the left also being colored; Count: seven), 0(empty), 0(empty)]\n\nWe find that the seven(7) middle pixels are \"adjacent\".\n\n- The following are examples where pixels with the value of 2 are not \"adjacent\" to each other due to intervening empty pixels. There are two example pixel grids below. Study them carefully.\n\n[2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2] -> This pixel list has nine(9) pixels. In this pixel list, none of the pixels are \"adjacent\". We count them like the following:\n\n[2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(isolated), 0(empty), 2(isolated)]\n\nWe find that none of the pixels are \"adjacent\".\n\n[0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0] -> This pixel list has nine(9) pixels.

There are six example pixel grids below. Study them carefully.\n\n[2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2] -> This pixel list has seven(7) pixels. In this pixel list, only the three(3) rightmost pixels are \"adjacent\". The other pixels are not directly \"adjacent\" to another colored pixel, due to empty pixels between them.

An example pixel grid with all empty pixels is below. Study it carefully.\n\n[0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0]\n\n- If a pixel is a color between 1 and 9, but it is surrounded by empty pixels, it is part of the background.\n\n- If a pixel has value between 1 and 9, and \"adjacent\" to another pixel of a different value, it is part of the background. \n\n- If a pixel has value between 1 and 9, and \"adjacent\" to another pixel of the same value, it is part of an object.\n\n6) The following is how to identify the object or object we should extract.\n\nBefore beginning to look for objects, we need to identify what type of background we are looking at, so we can decide how to look for objects.\n\n- The first type of \"background type\" is pixel grid with empty pixels, a single-colored, single or double pixel thick line of pixels, which is bisecting the pixel grid into two distinct areas.\n\n- In this case, there will be two objects in each area, and each object will either both be squares, or both be rectangles. The squares or rectangles in either side of the pixel grid, can be made of different colors, or the same color.\n\n- Next depending on the orientation of the pixel grid, which in our testing scenario can only be a rectangular pixel grid, we place the objects we have chosen in a new bounding box, with no empty pixels between the objects. \n\n- If the objects in the original pixel grid are above and below each other, the bounding box should be a vertical box that can fit all extracted objects, with no empty pixels between them.\n\n- If the objects in the original pixel grid are left or right of each other in the horizontal plane of the pixel grid, the bounding box should be a horizontal box that can fit all extracted objects, with no empty pixels between them.\n\n- The object should be placed in the bounding box in the order they were found, from left to right, or top to bottom.\n\n- The objects will always be of the same size when this \"background type\" is present.\n\n--\n\n- The second type of \"background type\" is pixel grid with many single pixel dots scattered on the pixel grid.\n\n- In this case, there will be two or three squares on the pixel grid, which can be made of the same color, or be of different colors. The squares must be larger than 2 pixels squared, to be considered valid objects. The squares will be of the same size.\n\n- Next, we place the objects we have chosen in a new bounding box, with no empty pixels between the objects. \n\n- The bounding box should be a horizontal box that can fit all extracted objects, with no empty pixels between them, in the order they were found.\n\n- The objects composed of the largest amount of pixels \"adjacent\" to each other of the same value, that form a valid square of \"adjacent\" pixels, are the objects we need to extract. The square objects may be filled with pixels of the same color as themselves, or they may have empty pixels inside.\n\n7) The following is how to extract the objects we have chosen.\n\n- First, we count the number of pixels wide and tall, that the objects are, at the largest. This will allow us to know what size of bounding box to create, and how to copy the objects to a final pixel grid, which is the size of the bounding box.\n\nBelow is how to count the pixels of an arbitrary object, presented on a pixel grid.\n\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0],\n[2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2],\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0],\n[2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\nThe pixel grid above has six(6) rows and seven(7) columns. Rows are analyzed from left to right. Columns are analyzed top to bottom. We will analyze the pixel grid above with the algorithm below.\n\nWe state that we are now going to analyze the rows.\n\nWe now analyze the rows step-by-step.\n\nWe state that we are finished analyzing the rows.\n\nWe state the count of \"adjacent pixels\" at their widest, that are not part of the background are: three(3) pixels\n\nThe object is now known to be three(3) pixels wide.\n\nWe state that we are now going to analyze the columns.\n\nWe print the pixel grid again for reference.\n\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0],\n[2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2],\n[0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0],\n[2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2],\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\nWe now analyze the columns step-by-step.\n\nWe state that we are finished analyzing the columns. \n\nWe state the count of \"adjacent pixels\" at their tallest: four(4) pixels\n\nThe object is now known to be three(3) pixels tall.\n\n-Next we create a bounding box of empty pixels that match the size of the object.\n\nThe object is three(3) pixels wide, and three(3) pixels tall, so the bounding box must be three(3) pixels wide, and three(3) pixels tall. Below we create a pixel grid the size of the bounding box.\n\n[0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0],\n[0, 0, 0]\n\n-Next we create a copy of the object to the empty pixel grid we just created. This is our final answer.\n\n[2, 2, 2],\n[2, 0, 2],\n[2, 2, 2]\n\nThe object we have extracted has remained intact, in this case having a single empty pixel in the middle.\n\nPlease remember the following: \n\n- In our testing scenario, the objects we are going to extract will be of the same size, irrespective of the \"background type\" encountered.\n\n- Valid objects MUST be greater than 2 pixels squared.\n\n- So we pick the correct objects to extract, we first have to decide on what \"background type\" we are encountering, which will be one of the two described above.\n\nPlease solve the pixel grid below. Take a deep breath.

This object forms a distinct shape within the larger area of '2's and '3's. The '4's form a smaller square or block in the center of the grid.\n\nTo extract this single-colored object while preserving its exact shape and size, we identify the pixels that are '4's and separate them from the '2's and '3's. Here is the object composed of '4's extracted from the grid:\n\n```\n[4, 4]\n[4, 4]\n```\n\nThis is the multi-pixel single-colored object that stands out in the given pixel grid.
