This repo contains visualizations from the "Extract Object" Section of ConceptARC

The folder "ConceptARC_Extract_Object_Visualizations" contains two versions of the visualizations. 

- Inside the main folder, the folder "ARC_Editor_Visualizations_Original_Output" contains the original visualization output PNGs from the ARC Editor.

- Inside the main folder, the folder "ARC_Editor_Visualizations_Dark_Gray_Background" contains the original visualization output PNGs from the ARC Editor, with the background converted to dark gray, as it is easier on the eyes.
